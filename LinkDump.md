A place to dump links so I can finally close these tabs.

## Guides

These guides were, iirc, some of my original inspiration and information for making a dactyl manuform. I didn't follow either exactly but they're both useful:

## QMK Split

Generic split keyboard info, assumes using .h file for config:

Reference for info.json, can usually figure out how to map config .h to info.json in here:
