# Keyboards

I intend to use this repo to organize information about the keyboards that I make.

## Keyboard 1

The first keyboard I made is a 4x5 Dactyl Manuform. I 3D printed the case using pre-made files (I didn't modify the CAD parameters at all). It's hand-wired and uses a pair of Pi Picos as the brains. I used CAT3 cable to connect the halves, to avoid some of the potential issues with hot-plugging TRRS connectors. I tweaked the layout a couple times to get it where I like, but it's not quite perfect. I've been using it for several months now, on and off to some extent. It's pretty great for text, but suffers from too few buttons. Dates and times require a lot of layer switching to get between numbers and symbols and some shortcuts are still annoying to get to.

## Keyboard 2

My second keyboard is an Ergo DOX layout with a modified case design. I did the CAD for these myself, but got the key layout from an online generator using the standard ErgoDox layout. The case is a combination of laser cut 1/8th inch acrylic and 3D printed parts. I'm once again using Pi Picos for controllers.
